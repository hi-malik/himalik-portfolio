Professional Experience
CISCOOct 2024 – June 2025
Technical AnalystBerlin, Germany
•
Spearheaded the development of a Web3 decentralized application (DApp) using microservices architecture with
Java and Spring Boot, providing a scalable backend for blockchain interactions.
•
Designed and implemented smart contracts on Ethereum using Solidity, enabling secure and transparent
transactions within the DApp.
•
Developed microservices to handle user authentication, wallet integration, and transaction processing, each service
interacting with the blockchain via web3.js and managed independently for modularity.
•
Employed IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for decentralized storage, ensuring data integrity and availability
across the network.
•
Utilized Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, ensuring efficient deployment and scaling of
microservices within a cloud environment.
•
Implemented asynchronous communication between services using Kafka, optimizing transaction processing and
improving system reliability.
•
Collaborated with the DevOps team to establish CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing and secure
deployment of updates to the smart contracts and backend services.
•
Integrated AWS cloud services for deployment, monitoring, and scalability of decentralized applications.
CISCOApril 2023 – Oct 2024
Software DeveloperBerlin, Germany
•
Spearheaded the development of a Django + DRF project to architect an API focused on managing annotators and
their qualifications, integrating front-end technologies, particularly ReactJs, to enhance user interface and
experience.
•
Configured the project to use a MySQL database instead of the default SQLite database.
•
Implemented synthetic data within the database to accurately emulate real-world application scenarios, ensuring
the front-end components interacted seamlessly with backend data.
•
Given Public and Private Cloud Platform administration, Kubernetes configuration and support.
•
Utilized Python and Flask to build auxiliary microservices for handling lightweight backend tasks.
